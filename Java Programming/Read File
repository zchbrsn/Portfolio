//Purpose: Read data from a file and display as well as calculate how many data values read

//Import java IO and Scanner classes
import java.io.*;

		/*//Initialize variables

			//While loop to output info from file

			//Calculate data values read / times looped
			System.out.println(dataSum + " data values were read.");

		//Catch block
